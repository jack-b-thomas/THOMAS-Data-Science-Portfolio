### My Semester at a Glance:

#### [Unsupervised Machine Learning App](https://github.com/jack-b-thomas/THOMAS-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/portfolio_projects/MLUnsupervisedApp): A streamlit app where users can upload a dataset (or choose from to pre-uploaded NBA datasets). Users can choose between unsupervised machine learning modelsâ€“PCA or K-means Clustering. The app returns visualizations and statistics. This project helped me refine my python and web design skills, and afforded me hands-on experiences with unsupervised machine learning models.

#### [Machine Learning Streamlit App](https://github.com/jack-b-thomas/THOMAS-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/portfolio_projects/MLStreamlitApp): For this project, I create an app where users can upload their own data and choose between three supervised machine learning models. The app returns model specific metrics and visualizations. This project taught me a lot about streamlit, website design and the nuances of supervised machine learning models.

#### [Tidy Data Project](https://github.com/jack-b-thomas/THOMAS-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/portfolio_projects/TidyData-project): For this project, I convert a wide dataset (about X-Men comic valuations) into one that follows Tidy Data principles. This project taught me how to data clean properly, a skill that I will most likely use in all of my subsequent projects involving realworld data.

#### [Luka-AD Streamlit App](https://github.com/jack-b-thomas/THOMAS-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/portfolio_projects/luka_ad_trade_app): For this project, I created an app where you can compare  Luka Doncic and AD's stats between each other (and 20 other NBA players). This app was created in response to the wild Lakers-Mavericks Trade that sent Luka to LA for next to nothing in return.
