### My Most Recent Projects: 
- #### [Tidy Data Project](https://github.com/jack-b-thomas/THOMAS-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/portfolio_projects/TidyData-project): In this project, I convert a wide dataset into one that follows Tidy Data principles. This project taught me how to data clean properly, a skill that I will most likely use in all of my subsequent projects involving realworld data. 
- #### [Luka-AD Streamlit App](https://github.com/jack-b-thomas/THOMAS-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/portfolio_projects/luka_ad_trade_app): In this project, I created an app where you can compare  Luka Doncic and AD's stats between each other (and 20 other NBA players). This app was created in response to the wild Lakers-Mavericks Trade that sent Luka to LA for next to nothing in return.
