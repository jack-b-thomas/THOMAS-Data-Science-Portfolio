##### In this project, I was asked to make a given Dataset follow Tidy Data principles, as written by Hadley Wickham in [Tidy Data](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf). Put simply, Tudy Data a standard, specific way to format datasets that makes it easier to analyse, interpret and visualize. 
##### Using several functions in pandas such as `pd.melt()`, `.astype()`, `.fillna()`, `.str.replace()`, and others to make a wide  dataset into a standard, long dataset that is presentable and ready for visualization and interpretation. See the [pandas cheet sheet](https://pandas.pydata.org/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf) for most of the functions I used and some that I didnt. 
##### This project also includes two graphs of the cleaned data. 
##### The nuts and bolts:
  - ##### The Given Dataset: [Mutant MoneyBall](https://github.com/EliCash82/mutantmoneyball/tree/main). I used an adapted version which can be found in the [Data](https://github.com/jack-b-thomas/THOMAS-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/portfolio_projects/TidyData-project/Data) folder in the TidyData-Project folder.
    - ##### This is wide dataset that has multiple variables in a single column, confusing labels, confusing character names, and has numeric data that is an object type: all things that needed to be tidied. 
  - ##### Required Libraries: pandas as pd, numpy as np, seaborn as sns and matplotlib as plt, which can all be installed in VS Code using `!pip install` in your terminal, if not already.
    - ##### I don't think I actually ended up using numpy in the final version of the project, so you could delete that from the first code block and probably be fine. I just kept it in there to be safe. 
- ##### The project is in a jupyter notebook (no locally hosted app) so just download the file and open it your preferred workspace and you should be good to go!
