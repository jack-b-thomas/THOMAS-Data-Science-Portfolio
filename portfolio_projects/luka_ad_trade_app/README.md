## [Luka Got Traded for Next to Nothing!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKY541QqpH8)
#### This is an app I built after the Luka-Anthony Davis trade last week. You can compare their stats and watch some highlight reels. You can see if you think the trade makes sense based on those factors. This was mostly just me experimenting with some of the capabilities of streamlit. It was kinda fun.

#### You can compare the top 20 players in PpG in 15 different major statistical categories and see where AD and Luka fit to see if you would have made the trade if you were GM of the Mavs.

#### To run the app, you can either download the .py file and type `streamlit run Luka_AD.py` in the terminal (The required libaries are `pandas 2.2.3`, `plotly_express 0.4.1`, streamlit 1.37.1` and `streamlit_option_menu 0.4.0`. Or, you can see it on the [streamlit cloud](https://lukaadtrade.streamlit.app).

#### The data I used for this app comes from [NBA Stuffer](https://www.nbastuffer.com). It has a bunch of stats for players, teams and refs. I used the player data from the 2024-25 season for this app.</p>
