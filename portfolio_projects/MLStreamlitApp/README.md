## The Machine Learning Experience!
##### In this project, I was asked to make a streamlit app where users could upload their own dataset and run a supervised machine learning model on it. Users can select between four type of supervised machine learning models, and change hyperpermaters. I was then asked to publish this app to the streamlit cloud. 
##### In my app, "The Machine Learning Experience", the user can upload their own dataset, or choose from three preselected ones (Iris, Titanic, and Penguins). Then they can choose between `LinearRegression`, `LogisticRegression`, `KNeighborsClassifer`, and `DecisionTreeClassifier`. 
##### The app returns metrics and graphs relevant to each model. 
##### The nuts and bolts:
- ##### Required Libraries: `graphviz 0.20.1`, `matplotlib 3.10.1`, `numpy 2.2.4`, `pandas 2.2.3`, `scikit_learn 1.6.1`, `seaborn 0.13.2`, `streamlit 1.37.1` and `streamlit_option_menu 0.4.0`.
   - ##### There is also a `requirements.txt` file for further clarity.
- ##### You can either download the .py file and run the app using streamlit run, or you can go see it on the [streamlit cloud](https://jtmachinelearning.streamlit.app)!
