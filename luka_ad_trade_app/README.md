<h2> Luka got traded for next to nothing!</h2>
<p> This is an app I built after the Luka-Anthony Davis trade last week. You can compare their stats and watch some highlight reels. Then, you can see if you think the trade makes sense, but there were definitely a lot of other factors that went into the trade. This was mostly just me experimenting with some of the capabilities of streamlit. It was kinda fun. </p>
<p> The data I used for this app comes from NBAStuffer(https://www.nbastuffer.com). It has a bunch of stats for players, teams and refs. I used the player data from the 2024-25 season for this app. </p>
